# Large Files (> 100MB) - Require LFS or CDN
# ======================================
# These files are too large for regular GitHub.
# They should be hosted on a CDN (jsDelivr, Cloudflare R2, etc.)
# and accessed via HTTP Range Requests using wa-sqlite.

# Master tafsir DB (1.5GB combined tafsirs)
tafsirs/db/master.db

# Combined editions DB (475MB - all 294 translations)

# ======================================
# Source Toon Files (Replaced by SQLite DBs)
# ======================================
# The .toon files are the source format.
# We now have optimized SQLite DBs instead.
# Keeping .toon files in .gitignore to reduce repo size.

# - db/*.db (except editions.db) - small DBs
# - tafsirs/db/*.db (except master.db) - per-tafsir DBs
# - scripts/*.py - conversion scripts
# - editions.toon, info.toon - metadata files
